      <p><b>C</b> (pronounced like the letter c) <sup>[6]</sup> is a 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language">general-purpose</a> 
       computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by <mark>Dennis Ritchie</mark>, and remains very widely
        used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in 
        <mark>operating systems</mark>, <mark>device drivers</mark>, and protocol stacks, though decreasingly <sup>[7]</sup> for <mark>application</mark> software.
         C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers
         and <mark>embedded systems</mark>.</p>
     
        <p>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to utilities
 running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.<sup>[8]</sup> During the 1980s, C gradually gained 
popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,<sup>[9][10]</sup> with C compilers available for almost
<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">[citation needed]</a>.</sup> all modern computer architectures and 
operating systems. C has been standardized  by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C)and by ISO.</p>
